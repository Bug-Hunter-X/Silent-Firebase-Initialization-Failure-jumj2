# Silent Firebase Initialization Failure in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with Firebase initialization: silent failures. The code appears to run without errors, but Firebase services remain unresponsive.  This is often due to incorrect configuration or missing dependencies.

## Problem

The `initializeApp` function from the Firebase JavaScript SDK may fail silently if the `firebaseConfig` object is incomplete or contains incorrect values.  Without proper error handling, developers can spend significant time debugging why Firebase features aren't working.

## Solution

Robust error handling is crucial. The provided solution implements a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle initialization errors and provides informative error messages to the user.
